# Cash Register

## HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS
- the code in the programs starts by taking the first name and last name of the customer
- there are 6 items in the program where the user can select from (milk, pencil, biscuit, energy drink, shoes, slippers) they all have different parameters from the init method (ids, name, price)
- user selects the id of an item and inputs the quantity the user wants to purchase
- the user gets a prompt if it wants to add another item or not
- if user picks yes, the user can select another item to purchase
- if user picks no, the user gets 4 option to add, update, remove, or print the invoice
- the add method would allow the user to select another item in the program
- the update method would allow the user to change the quantity of the item previously selected
- the remove method would remove an item that the user selected
- the print method would print the invoice total of the user
- it would display the customer name, date, total items, subtotal of specific items, and total price of all items purchased or the whole transaction
